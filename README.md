Welcome to the Router Hacking Tool ! This project is a powerful tool designed to assist in the exploration and testing of router configurations, leveraging the capabilities of GNS (Graphical Network Simulator) for simulated network environments. The provided documentation offers detailed insights into various routing protocols, including EIGRP, RIP, and more.

Overview
The Router Hacking Tool empowers users to:

Explore and analyze router configurations in simulated environments.
Test different routing protocols such as EIGRP, RIP, OSPF, and more.
Identify vulnerabilities and security loopholes in router configurations.
Experiment with various network topologies to understand their impact on routing behavior.
Installation Instructions
To get started with the Router Hacking Tool, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have GNS installed and configured properly.
Import the provided router configurations into GNS to set up the simulated network environment.
Refer to the documentation for detailed instructions on using the tool and exploring router configurations.
Usage
Once the simulated network environment is set up in GNS, launch the Router Hacking Tool to start exploring and testing router configurations. Follow the instructions provided in the documentation to perform various tasks, such as:

Analyzing routing tables and neighbor relationships.
Configuring and testing different routing protocols.
Identifying security vulnerabilities and implementing countermeasures.
Features
The Router Hacking Tool offers a range of features to facilitate router configuration exploration and testing:

Simulated network environment for safe experimentation.
Support for multiple routing protocols, including EIGRP, RIP, OSPF, and more.
Detailed documentation providing guidance on tool usage and router configuration exploration.
Potential for discovering and mitigating security risks in router configurations.
